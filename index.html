        <span>Rolling dice is a fun way to add randomness to games, puzzles, and even creative projects. Here's a quick guide to get you started:<br/><br/>

            Standard dice: A six-sided die, also known as a d6, has numbers 1-6 on its sides.<br/><br/>
            Multi-sided dice: There are many types of multi-sided dice, such as d8, d10, d12, and d20, each with different numbers of sides.<br/><br/>
            Dice rolls: To roll a die, simply randomly select a number between 1 and the number of sides on the die.<br/><br/>
            Rolling tips: You can roll one or multiple dice at a time, and some games use special dice with different numbers or symbols on each side. Have fun</span>
